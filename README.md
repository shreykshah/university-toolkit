## Introduction

The scripts in this repo are scripts I've written for myself to solve problem I encounter in university life that friends or other people have asked to use. The scripts are in various states of cleanliness/readability, although they should be fairly self explanatory on how to use them. If you happen to see me use any scripts that you wish to use, please feel free to ask me and it's very likely I will give you access.

## [DistanceBetweenMultiplePoints](https://github.com/shreykshah/DistanceBetweenMultiplePoints)

Can be used to determine meeting places or find housing, such that travel time is minimized.
